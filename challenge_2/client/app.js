// express should serve up an express file with reference to index.html

// The client app should be able to submit JSON data to the server,
// receive a response containing a CSV-formatted result (the way this is done will vary depending on where you are in the challenge).

// Do not use any external libraries (such as via npm).
// You may use jQuery on the client.

// a bit confused, we are supposed to use default form submission
